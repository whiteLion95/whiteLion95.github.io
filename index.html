        This is my first website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not quite sure what to write here, 
        so I'll just jot down the thoughts 
        that come to mind as I type.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days, I'm preparing for the trainee test for 
        a .NET developer position at a company called Andersen. 
        I've filled my gaps in C# and learned SQL. 
        Right now, I'm studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        After that, I'll be moving on to ASP.NET.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm determined to pass the test this time 
        and eventually receive an offer for a Junior .NET developer role.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is my learning plan:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>ASP.NET</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        My overall goals for life right now are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure a stable high-salary job as a developer</li>
        <li>Have side projects to increase income</li>
        <li>Make games as a hobby in free time</li>
        <li>Eventually have enough passive income for comfortable and happy life</li>
    </ul>
